  /**
   * <p>Add a <em>doAction</em> to this method.</p>
   *
   * <p><em>doActions</em> are arbitrary actions that are executed, in order,
   * during invocation of mocked methods. These actions can be applied to
   * any mock, including those that use {@link #thenCallRealMethod()}.</p>
   *
   * <p>The action receives the actual arguments the method was
   * called with as an immutable <code>List</code>.</p>
   *
   * <p>It is possible to chain multiple actions on a single invocation,
   * for example:</p>
   *
   * <pre><code>
   *   Moxy.when(() -> mock.something("arg"))
   *       .thenDo(args -&gt; System.out.println("mock.something called"))
   *       .thenDo(args -&gt; customRecorder.record("something", args))
   *       .thenCallRealMethod();
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * <p><strong>Note:</strong> For a given invocation, all matching <em>doActions</em>
   * will be invoked, even if they weren't (intentionally) applied to the
   * given arguments. This only applies when argument matchers are used.</p>
   *
   * <p>As an example of this potentially-confusing behaviour, consider the
   * following example:</p>
   *
   * <pre><code>
   *   Moxy.when(() -&gt; mock.hasTwoArgs(Matchers.any(), Matchers.eqInt(5)))
   *     .thenDo(() -&gt; System.out.println("Action 1"));
   *     .thenDo(() -&gt; System.out.println("Action 2"));
   *
   *   Moxy.when(() -&gt mock.hasTwoArgs(Matchers.eq("Bill"), Matchers.anyInt()))
   *     .thenDo(() -&gt System.out.println("Action 3"));
   *
   *   mock.hasTwoArgs("Bill", 5);
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * <p>In this example, the invocation <code>mock.hasTwoArgs("Bill", 5)</code> matches
   * <em>both</em> stubbed invocations, so all actions will run, resulting in the
   * following output:</p>
   *
   * <pre><code>
   *   Action 1
   *   Action 2
   *   Action 3
   * </code></pre>
   *
   * <p>I.e., since the framework has no way to tell exactly which of the two
   * potential matching preconditions you actually wanted, it calls them both.</p>
   *
   * <p>For this reason, you should exercise caution when using matchers with
   * <em>doActions</em>, to ensure you only execute actions on the invocations
   * you actually want to invoke them on. This is especially true where your
   * actions have side effects.</p>
   *
   * @since 1.0
   * @param action The action, usually as a lambda.
   *
   * @return <code>this</code>, for continued stubbing.
